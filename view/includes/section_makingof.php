      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p><i>"Don't be shy to ask"</i></p>
      <p> It wasn’t easy to find someone who has time to answer questions for the interview – even webdevs always in-front of PC/laptop/few extra screens - they are busy with more important things, like making animation of kittens (adore that), so after sending
        out few messages in <a href="http://linkedin.com">Linkedin</a> and waiting for several days the answer, I gave up and start asking around my friends on social media. It was faster than I expected and with first response I made this web-site.
