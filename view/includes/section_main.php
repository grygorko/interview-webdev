      <h3>Junior WebDeveloper <br> at BeCode.org</h3>
      <p>Century in which we are living, brings a lot of new discoveries and challenges. Everyday we face new problems and find solutions for them... if it doesn’t happen – we seek to understand it. That’s why after working closely with web-design, web-analytics,
        social media ads etc, I have decided to look for on-line courses which will explain more about INTERNET and how it works. With that amount of data on-line I’ve got a bit confused and realize that I need help from people in real world which I found
        in BeCode.org. Since then everyday is full of new lessons that can be easily absorbed, because of the environment and people around who has the same goals .</p>
